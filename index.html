            <li>Email </li>
                <p>Email used to be a simple system to send messages over the internet instead of through the mail. Since its creation in 1971, email has been quietly moving into many aspects of our daily lives, such as automated notifications for medical and automotive check-ups, home security monitoring, and company collaboration. It's become a way of automating our lives.</p>
            <li>Storage, backup, and data retrieval </li>
                <p>In an increasingly digitized business landscape, data backup is vital for the survival of an organization. You can get hacked or ransomed, and lose your data to thieves who’ll sell your trade secrets to the highest bidder. Injected malware can corrupt your hard-earned information. Disgruntled employees or other insider threats can delete your valuable digital assets. Can you recover from data loss?

                    Data backup is a practice that combines techniques and solutions for efficient and cost-effective backup. Your data is copied to one or more locations, at pre-determined frequencies, and at different capacities. You can set up a flexible data backup operation, using your own architecture, or make use of available Backup as a Service (BaaS) solutions, mixing them up with local storage. Today, there are plenty of corporate storage TCO solutions to help you calculate costs, avoid data loss, and prevent data breaches.</p>  
            <li>Creating and testing apps</li>
                <p>Application Testing is defined as a software testing type conducted through scripts with the motive of finding errors in software. It deals with tests for the entire application.

                    It helps to enhance the quality of your applications while reducing costs, maximizing ROI, and saving development time.
                    
                    In Software Engineering, Application testing can be done in various categories like GUI, functionality, database (backend), load test, etc.
                    
                    For Application Testing, the testing lifecycles involve various phases which include requirement analysis, test planning, test analysis, test design, test execution & bug reporting, etc.</p>
            <li>Analyzing data</li>
                <p>Data analysis is the process of collecting, modeling, and analyzing data using various statistical and logical methods and techniques. Businesses rely on analytics processes and tools to extract insights that support strategic and operational decision-making.

                    All these various methods are largely based on two core areas: quantitative and qualitative research.
                    
                    To explain the key differences between qualitative and quantitative research, here’s a video for your viewing pleasure</p>
            <li>Audio and video streaming </li>
                <p>This is possible because of a technology called streaming. Streaming is the continuous transmission of audio or video files from a server to a client. In simpler terms, streaming is what happens when consumers watch TV or listen to podcasts on Internet-connected devices.</p>
